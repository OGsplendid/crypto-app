The application that allows to try yourself in crypto investing

# Used:

1. React Context;
2. Ant design;
3. react-chartjs-2

RTK query was a better choice here to subscribe for updates but Context used to practice with it and due to API restrictions. So data is renewed for the first load and when new currency is added to your portfolio. API is real so currency rates are up-to-date. Data cached in localStorage.
